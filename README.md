## 🛠️ Technology Stack & Tools

This project was built using a modern, industry-standard stack:

*   **🐍 Backend:** **Flask** (A powerful micro-framework for building the web server and API)
*   **🤖 Machine Learning:** **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **XGBoost** (For data manipulation, preprocessing, and building a robust prediction model)
*   **🎨 Frontend:** **HTML** & **CSS** (For a clean and simple user interface)
*   **🚀 Deployment & DevOps:** **Docker** (For containerizing the application to ensure consistency) and **Hugging Face Spaces** (For seamless deployment and hosting)
*   **💻 Code & Version Control:** **Git** & **GitHub**

---

## 📋 Key Features

*   **Seamless User Experience:** A simple, intuitive web form for data entry. No complex commands needed.
*   **Real-time Inference:** The XGBoost model provides predictions instantly upon submission.
*   **Modular & Scalable Codebase:** The project is structured with a clear separation of concerns (Flask app, prediction pipeline, utilities), making it easy to maintain and extend.
*   **Reproducible Environment:** Thanks to Docker and a detailed `requirements.txt`, anyone can replicate the exact environment and run the project flawlessly.

## 💡 Future Roadmap

This project is a solid foundation, but there's always room to grow. Here are a few ideas for future enhancements:

*   [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implement GitHub Actions to automatically test and deploy new changes.
*   [ ] **User Accounts & History:** Allow users to create accounts and view their past predictions.
*   [ ] **Model Monitoring:** Integrate tools to monitor model performance and detect data drift over time.
*   [ ] **A/B Testing:** Deploy multiple models simultaneously to see which one performs best in a live environment.
